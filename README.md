# The Essential Cheat Sheet for Open Source Projects

### What is Open Source?
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Anyone who has Internet access can benefit from Open Source Software.

### Basics of Open Source Projects
- **Popular Open Source Platforms:**
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
  - [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

- **Keywords when starting with Open Source:**
  - Forking
  - cloning
  - committing
  - pushing
  - opening pull requests

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Open Source Communities:** Groups of developers and non-coders who collaborate on open source projects.
  - **Source Code:** The original code which can be viewed, modified, and distributed under an open source license.
  - **License:** Terms under which Open Source Software can be used, modified, and distributed.
  - **Contribute:** It can take the form of debugging, fixing code, making corrections to project documents. Anyone can contribute to Open Source Projects regardless of their coding skills.
  - **Forking:** A copy of a repository owned by an organization, community, or user. It allows the user to experiment, make changes in the forked repository, and then make a pull request to the original project for their changes to be included.
  - **Cloning:** Creates a copy of a repository from a remote server to a local one.
  - **Tag:** A keyword through which to look for projects.

- **Key Components of Open Source Projects:**
  - Maintainers
  - contributors
  - source code repository
  - project license

### Exploring Open Source Projects
- **Finding Projects:**
  - Choose a project based on your skill level and interests. You can search them by:
    - programming language
    - category
    - tags.

- **Categories to Begin Looking for Your Next Project:**
  - Programming Languages
  - Frameworks and Libraries
  - Data Engineering
  - DevOps and Cloud
  - Web Development
  - Mobile Development
  - Game Development
  - Security
  - Miscellaneous

- **Tags You Can Use:**
  - ‘good-first-issue’,
  - ‘beginner-friendly’,
  - ‘first-timers-only’,
  - ‘easy-pick’,
  - ‘starter-project’,
  - ‘newbie-friendly’,
  - ‘intermediate’,
  - ‘medium-difficulty’,
  - ‘improvement-needed’,
  - ‘enhancement’,
  - ‘feature-request’,
  - ‘bug-fix’,
  - ‘up-for-grabs’,
  - ‘help-wanted’

### Getting Started
1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
2. Familiarize yourself with **[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc)** and **[Version Controlling](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)**.

- **Getting Involved with Open Source:**
  - Creating your own Open Source Project.
  - Contributing to an existing Open Source Project.

- **Upon Landing on an Open Source Project:**
  - **The README File:** Contains all you need to know about the project and where to find information.
  - **The Code of Conduct:** Includes all the rules that the Community will abide by.
  - **The CONTRIBUTING.md:** Details all you need to know before you start contributing to a project, including commit messages and pull requests.
  - **LICENSE**

- **Next Steps:**
  - Land on **“Issues”** and browse through them to understand where you can help the project. Issues that need immediate help are usually tagged with **help-wanted**. Once you find the issue you are interested in solving, start interacting with the Maintainer to take up the issue and ask any necessary questions.

- **Common Types of Contributions:**
  - Reporting bugs and issues.
  - Writing documentation.
  - Fixing bugs.
  - Adding features.
  - Leading development efforts.
  - Documentation and translations.
  - Design and user interface.
  - Organizing and event planning.
  - Code review and testing.

- **Maintaining a Respectful and Inclusive Environment:**
  - Read and abide by the project’s documentation, coding standards, and contribution process. Respect the community’s norms and etiquette, including how to report, respond to comments, make commits, and pull requests.
  - Open Source is about collaborating with others: Be polite, constructive, and responsive to feedback from maintainers and other contributors.
  - Start small—keep doing it—think big: Start by tackling small tasks and making small pull requests, then make incremental changes. Keep your documentation clear, preferably by using markdown.
